## About The Project

https://ryanwong.ca/cars

This project was created from my interest in wanting to showcase my model car collection. This includes my Lego, Tomica, Hotwheels and other various types of model cars I own. It allows users to filter through my collection by specifying one more multiple brands and the type of model (Lego, Tomica or Hotwheels). It also allows the user to view the real life specifications of the car that the model is made after, including engine, tire, speed and other specifications. I also can add new cars from a local (for now) admin page that points to a Express API (not included in this repository) that I have running in order to add new cars and retrieve data from the MongoDB. The front end is hosted on Netlify, back end hosted using Fly.io and the database using MongoDB Atlas.

This site includes the following features:
* Filtering model cars based on the type (Logo, Tomica or Hotwheels)
* Allowing the user to see the real life specifications of the car
* Express API in order to retrieve the data from the MongoDB (Not included in this repository) from specified endpoints.
* A grid displaying the model cars with a photo
* Page system, only displaying a custom amount of cars on a page
